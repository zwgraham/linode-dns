This script was written out of the desire to have my router dynamically update my linode account's dns entries. Dynamic IP updaters already exist, but my router and servers do not run python 3. This is meant to be called on a server, with python 2.7, via ssh.

I added a cron job to my router that periodically calls updater.py on a remote server.


#Example (using public key cryptogrophy)
#!/bin/sh
#
USER=user
HOST=host
P=/path/to/script
WANIF=br0
ipaddr=$(ip -4 addr show $WANIF|grep "inet "|awk '{print $2}|cut -d'/' -f1')
ssh $USER@$HOST -C "python ${P}/updater.py -4 $ipaddr"
